                    <p>
                        After observing the trends with TECNO smartphones in the market,
                        I gained a fairly good grasp of their life cycles. I remember a few
                        weeks after the launch of the TECNO Phantom A, someone said to me
                        that she would wait till it had dropped in price to a certain level.
                        I smiled and responded to her that if she kept that attitude, she
                        would not get a Phantom A to buy. True to my projections, in a few weeks,
                        the Phantom A+ hit the market and the A became extinct. It was almost nowhere
                        to be found, much less at the price that she was looking for. And the newer
                        flagship cost more.</p>
                    <p>
                        My point? If you see a TECNO smartphone out there that you really like,
                        go and get it now, because TECNO smartphones have short life cycles in
                        the market. Usually, a couple of months after release is all the window
                        that is open for you to buy that model that you like before it disappears off the shelves.
